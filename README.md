## Overview

This application is a chance for students to build an app that helps users choose a dish and put together meals. This Solo Challenge gave us a chance to show where we are with the foundational concepts of the Mod 1 curriculum. In this challenge, we utilize HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a functional app that will select a random dish based on what the user is looking for.
